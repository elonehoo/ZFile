## Introduction

Due to the increasing personal requirements for the page, and the more and more disgusted with the pages written by myself, I found a [little partner`sunboyZgz`](https://github.com/sunboyZgz), and proceeded to the [project front-end](https:// github.com/sunboyZgz/ZFile-front) .

## Project Introduction

ZFIle is a visual Linux operation project. You can easily manipulate the Linux server with the simplest visualization method. We are not creating a desktop for the server, but for some users who are not very familiar with the Linux server when they have just come into contact with it. Next, provide a set of highly feasible alternative solutions.
